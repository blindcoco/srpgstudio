Unit Command Placement
By Blindcoco
Version 1.0
August 7th 2021

This plugin moves the Unit Commands a bit lower in the Unit Menu instead of being near the top. 

Note: This plugin might clash with other plugins that affect the command list (like Goinza's Combat Art's plugin). 
As a temporary fix to avoid this issue, make sure that this plugin is loaded first.
